They were good, but the patina from the leather can make the phone look a bit old.  So, I thought I give the silicone case a try.  Overall the fit is 9/10.  It feels a little looser than the leather of previous generations, but it\u2019s good enough and I had no issue with it popping out of the phone.  After 3 months of use, the corners are showing some wear.  The matte finish becomes semi-gloss.  This doesn\u2019t bother me however.  One good thing about silicone case is that it doesn\u2019t slip out of my pocket like the leather one does.  Overall, this case meets my expectations, and I will purchase it again for my future iPhones."}, {"Reviewer Name": "Brandon S.", "Review Title": "Well worth it", "Review Date": "Reviewed in the United States on January 13, 2024", "Review Rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "Review Data": "I\u2019ve had dozens of cases throughout the years but this one is probably my favorite.

I love this case, it's protected my phone, but ... each time the phone is dropped another chunk of silicone breaks or peels off the case. The color is great, the feel is great, not too sticky or slippery, nice feel in my hand, slim. I understand silicone and there is a fine balance between how hard to make it vs look and feel. For me the look and feel of the product when I am carrying it was more important so I bought another one and know it will only last me a year or so."}, {"Reviewer Name": "Diego Quesada", "Review Title": "", "Review Date": "Reviewed in the United States on March 18, 2024", "Review Rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "Review Data": "Excelente, como esperado!"}, {"Reviewer Name": "tim cadle", "Review Title": "Great Value For This iPhone Case!", "Review Date": "Reviewed in the United States on October 5, 2023", "Review Rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "Review Data": "I was a little hesitant about buying this case considering the price-point, but I figured I\u2019d give it a try after it went on sale.  I am so glad that I did!  The fit is absolutely perfect, the texture is perfect for griping but not being too sticky, and it cleans very easily.  I got white concrete dust all over my hands, and I had to use my phone, so I got that dust all over the case while I was holding it.  It wiped right off with a cloth, none of it stuck to the case, which I thought was very impressive with how sticky that dust can be.  I\u2019ve gotten it on tool handles, and other things where it actually stuck to it.  So definitely good on the ease of cleaning.  Also, if anyone is curious, this case\u2019s silicone material matches the feel of the silicone on the iPad Magic Keyboard Case, and it also perfectly color matches with the black one.  And the magsafe capabilities are awesome!  I would highly recommend this case. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb"}, {"Reviewer Name": "K. downs", "Review Title": "Extremely disappointed", "Review Date": "Reviewed in the United States on February 27, 2024", "Review Rating": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "Review Data": "In the past I\u2019ve used the Apple leather case, but I have to replace it every year or so.  This time I tried the silicon version thinking it would hold up longer than the leather.  Within a few months after purchase it started peeling on all 4 corners.  Then the other day the whole silicone outer layer started ripping when I took it out of my pocket.  Today is February 27 and I just got this iPhone cover July 23.  Super disappointed in this Apple product.  For $50, it should basically last the lifetime of the iPhone, right??  I\u2019m giving up and going with a cheaper generic at this point. At least when it breaks I don\u2019t have to feel so cheated that way."}, {"Reviewer Name": "Avery Olson", "Review Title": "Pretty good!", "Review Date": "Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2024", "Review Rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "Review Data": "It's a pretty good phone case, but I do have a few tings to mention. I was very disappointed as the magnet on the case isn't very strong. I saw complaints about others cases starting to wear really fast and I don't have very much of that yet (I've had it for a few weeks now) and I hope I don't get any wear anytime soon. Paying 50$ for a name brand phone case is insane so I shouldn't experience wear and tear after a month like others complained of."}, {"Reviewer Name": "Brent Brewer", "Review Title": "LEATHERS BETTER.", "Review Date": "Reviewed in the United States on March 1, 2024", "Review Rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "Review Data": "."}]
